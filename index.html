    <h2>What is 3dimensions?</h2>
    <p>3dimensions is, in essence, a political quiz that attempts to assign percentages for three political axes. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br /></p>
    <p>There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions.</p>
